# pyLiBELa

**pyLiBELa** is our first attempt to expose all the existing *LiBELa* functions to a Python environment. We want to bring ligand docking to everyone through easy-to-use platforms such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com/). 

The code is currently being converted using [Boost Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html) functions, allowing C++ code to be executed integrated in the Python environment. 

Some new functions are also under develoment, including some GPU-based function to speed-up interaction energy calculations and interaction grid generation.

The project is under active development. Stay tuned to more info!!!
